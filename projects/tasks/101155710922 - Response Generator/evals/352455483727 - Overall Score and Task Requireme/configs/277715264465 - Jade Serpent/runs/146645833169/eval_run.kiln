  "input": "假如当日北京市环境空气质量首要污染物为$PM_{2.5}$，当日$PM_{2.5}$的24小时平均浓度为$100$微克/立方米。请计算当日北京空气质量指数（$AQI$）。",
  "output": "To calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM₂.₅ when the concentration is 100 micrograms per cubic meter, follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pollutant and Breakpoints:**\n   - The primary pollutant is PM₂.₅.\n   - Refer to the AQI breakpoints for PM₂.₅.\n\n2. **Breakpoint Ranges for PM₂.₅ (AQI):**\n   | Range of µg/m³ | Corresponding AQI  |\n   |----------------|--------------------|\n   | 0–50           | 0–50               |\n   | 51–100         | 51–100             |\n   | 101–150        | 101–150            |\n\n3. **Determine the AQI:**\n   - The concentration is 100 µg/m³.\n   - This falls within the range of 51–100 µg/m³, corresponding to an AQI of 51–100.\n\n4. **Calculate the Exact AQI:**\n   - Since each microgram increment corresponds directly to one AQI point:\n     \\[\n     AQI = 100\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM₂.₅ on that day is **100**.\n\n\\boxed{100}",

    "chain_of_thought": "The model's output accurately calculates the Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM₂.₅ at a concentration of 100 micrograms per cubic meter. Here’s the evaluation based on the outlined steps:\n\n1) **Factual Correctness**: The model provides a completely accurate calculation, identifying PM₂.₅ as the pollutant and correctly applying the AQI breakpoints. The final AQI value of 100 is correct.\n\n2) **Logical Reasoning**: The logical progression in the model's reasoning is clear. It identifies the pollutant, references the correct breakpoints, and demonstrates the process of determining the AQI. The reasoning aligns well with the expected steps.\n\n3) **Calculation Process**: The calculation is correct, and the steps are organized and clear. The way the model relates the concentration to the AQI range and confirms the AQI calculation is easy to follow. Additionally, it correctly states the relationship between concentration and AQI points.\n\nOverall, the model's performance meets the highest standard in all evaluated categories. There are no noticeable errors or omissions.\n\nGiven this assessment, the appropriate score for the model's performance on this task is **5**."
