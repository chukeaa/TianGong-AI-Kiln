  "input": "假如当日北京市环境空气质量首要污染物为$PM_{2.5}$，当日$PM_{2.5}$的24小时平均浓度为$100$微克/立方米。请计算当日北京空气质量指数（$AQI$）。",

  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance, let's analyze its output step by step against the defined requirements.\n\n1) **Factual Correctness**: \n   - The model calculated the AQI as 133 based on the given 24-hour average concentration of PM2.5 at 100 µg/m³. I can confirm that according to standard AQI calculation methods, an average concentration of PM2.5 of 100 µg/m³ indeed corresponds to an AQI in the range of 101-150, which is typically classified as \"Unhealthy for sensitive groups.\" Therefore, the specific AQI value of 133 appears to be accurate.\n\n2) **Logical Reasoning**: \n   - The model's reasoning seems clear and aligns with the task at hand. It acknowledged the need to compute the AQI based on the PM2.5 concentration and delivered a specific value without any evident flaws in reasoning.\n\n3) **Calculation Process**:\n   - The model provided the output succinctly and correctly identified key aspects (the pollution type and corresponding index). However, it could have improved the output by providing the calculation steps or referring to the specific AQI calculation formula, as it could help clarify and demonstrate the logical process behind acquiring the AQI value.\n\nGiven this breakdown:\n- The model's output is largely accurate with a correct final answer.\n- The reasoning is sound, correlating well with the required content.\n- The output omits intermediate calculation steps.\n\nFinal Evaluation:\n- **Factual Correctness**: 5 (Completely accurate)\n- **Logical Reasoning**: 5 (Clear and rigorous)\n- **Calculation Process**: 4 (Accurate but lacks detailed steps)\n\nConsidering the overall adherence to the requirement guidelines with just a slight omission in the detail of the calculation process, the appropriate score for this task would be **4**. \n\nThus, the overall score for this task should be:\n\n**4**."
