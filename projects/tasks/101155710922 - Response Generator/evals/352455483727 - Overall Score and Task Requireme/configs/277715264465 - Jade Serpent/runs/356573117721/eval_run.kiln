  "input": "假设一个污水处理厂每天处理100万升含有200 mg/L可降解生物质的废水，{CH2O}。在25°C条件下，计算每天需要向废水中泵入的干空气体积（氧气体积占比为20.95%），以提供降解生物质所需的氧气。",
  "output": "根据上述计算，每天需要大约775.5立方米的空气来处理产生的CH₂O。因此，最终答案是：\n\n$\\boxed{775\\ \\text{m}^3}$",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance based on the provided requirements, let's analyze its output step-by-step.\n\n1. **Factual Correctness**: The model's output indicates that approximately 775.5 cubic meters of air is needed. This number seems to be derived from calculations related to the required oxygen for degrading the given biodegradable substance (CH₂O). However, without the detailed reasoning or calculations shown in the response, we cannot fully verify if this figure is factually correct or if it aligns with the expected outcome based on the input data. Therefore, while it presents an answer, it lacks explicit calculation details, leading to some uncertainty regarding its absolute correctness.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**: The output is relatively clear and concludes with a boxed answer, which is good practice for presenting numerical results. However, the lack of detailed work or reasoning behind how the number was obtained hinders the overall logic assessment. If the logic was thorough and correctly followed, a definitive evaluation could be made.\n\n3. **Calculation Process**: The model does not provide the step-by-step breakdown of calculations leading to the result of 775 m³ of air needed. Key steps or calculations such as the conversion of mg/L to the required oxygen volume aren't shown, making it challenging to fully assess whether the calculation process was thorough and accurate. The response does not specify if significant figures or methodological variations were considered, which is also a requirement for higher scoring.\n\nGiven these evaluations:\n\n- **Factual Correctness** is ambiguous with at least some merit, but insufficient to guarantee its complete accuracy.\n- **Logical Reasoning** is reasonable but lacks rigorous backing.\n- **Calculation Process** has substantial gaps; it lacks detail, making it hard to follow or verify.\n\nWith these points in mind, the overall assessment leans closer to a score of 3. This implies that while there are noticeable errors or gaps in the model's performance, it demonstrates an understanding of the request and produces a result that resembles what would be expected, albeit without the necessary rigor or explicit steps.\n\n**Final Score: 3**"
