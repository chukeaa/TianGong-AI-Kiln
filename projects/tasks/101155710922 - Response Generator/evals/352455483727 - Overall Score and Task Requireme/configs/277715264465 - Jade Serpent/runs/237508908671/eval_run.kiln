  "input": "如何利用同位素示踪技术进行环境污染源的追踪？",
  "output": "同位素示踪技术通过分析环境样品中稳定同位素（如碳、氮、氧的同位素）或放射性同位素的组成，确定污染物的来源和扩散路径。不同污染源具有特定的同位素指纹，能够帮助区分污染源并追踪其迁移过程。",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's output based on the provided requirements, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Factual Correctness**: The model's output accurately describes how isotopic tracing technology can be used to track environmental pollution sources. It correctly mentions the use of stable isotopes (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen) and radioactive isotopes, as well as the concept of specific isotopic fingerprints to differentiate pollution sources. Hence, it meets the requirement for factual correctness with no significant omissions. \n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**: The reasoning in the output is clear and coherent. The model logically explains how isotopes help in determining the source and migration of pollutants. There are no apparent flaws in the logical flow.\n\n3. **Calculation Process**: Although there are no calculations involved in this context, the explanation is structured and aligns well with the core concepts of isotopic tracing. It does not fall short in any way related to a process, as there’s no calculation involved.\n\nBased on the analysis, the model's output is completely accurate and covers all key points without omissions. It shows clear logical reasoning. \n\nConsidering the overall performance aligned closely with the 5-point criteria:\n- Factual Correctness: Completely accurate\n- Logical Reasoning: Clear and rigorous\n\nAn appropriate overall score for this task would be **5**."
