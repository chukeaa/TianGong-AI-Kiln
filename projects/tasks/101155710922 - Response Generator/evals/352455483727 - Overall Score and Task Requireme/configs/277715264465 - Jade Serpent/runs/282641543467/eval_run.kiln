  "input": "在进行空气质量监测时,如何计算空气质量指数（AQI）以及确定首要污染物？",
  "output": "空气质量指数（AQI）的计算过程如下：\n\n首先，对于每种污染物（如PM2.5、PM10、SO2、NO2、CO、O3等），根据其实测浓度值（Cp），参考相应地区的空气质量分指数及对应的污染物项目浓度限值表（如GB 3095—2018），计算出每种污染物的空气质量分指数（IAQI）。\n\nIAQI的计算公式为：\n\nIAQI = (Cp - BPLo) / (BPHI - BPLO) × (IAQIH - IAQIL) + IAQIL\n\n其中，BPLo和BPHI分别为与Cp相近的污染物浓度限值的低位值和高位值，IAQIL和IAQIH分别为与BPLo和BPHI对应的空气质量分指数。\n\n然后，比较所有污染物的IAQI值，取最大值作为AQI。当AQI大于50时，IAQI最大对应的污染物即为首要污染物。",

    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance based on the provided requirements, let's break down the provided output against the established criteria.\n\n1) **Factual Correctness**: The model accurately describes the process for calculating the air quality index (AQI) and identifies how to determine the primary pollutant. It mentions the specific pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3) and provides the correct formula for calculating the individual air quality index (IAQI) as well as the method for identifying the primary pollutant based on the maximum IAQI value. Therefore, this aspect is covered comprehensively without any significant errors.\n\n2) **Logical Reasoning**: The output is logically structured, walking the reader through the calculation process step by step. The reasoning is coherent and aligned with standard practices for determining AQI and the primary pollutant. Each component connects logically to the next, demonstrating clear reasoning.\n\n3) **Calculation Process**: The model accurately provides the formula needed for calculation and explains how to apply it. The output is organized and provides a coherent sequence of steps leading to determining the AQI and the primary pollutant.\n\nConsidering the above evaluations:\n\n- The factual correctness is fully covered, with no omissions or inaccuracies.\n- The logical reasoning is clear and well-aligned with what can be expected for this topic.\n- The calculation process is correct, organized, and follows core logical steps.\n\nBased on these observations, the output qualifies for the highest score concerning accuracy and clarity in addressing the task. Thus, the appropriate overall score for this task is 5."
