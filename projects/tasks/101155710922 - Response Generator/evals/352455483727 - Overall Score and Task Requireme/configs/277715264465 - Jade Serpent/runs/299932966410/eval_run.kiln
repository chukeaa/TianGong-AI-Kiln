    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance based on the given requirements, let's assess its output step by step:\n\n1. **Factual Correctness**: The model provides a detailed classification of water functions according to the \"Surface Water Environment Quality Standards\" (《地表水环境质量标准》). The five types mentioned (drinking water, domestic water, industrial water, ecological water, and recreational water) are accurate and aligned with common classifications. Each type includes an appropriate monitoring project applicability and function. Therefore, it covers all key points accurately.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**: The output is logically structured, presenting each water body classification followed by its applicability and function. The reasoning is clear and does not deviate from the expected answer structure based on the query posed.\n\n3. **Calculation Process**: While this task does not involve a calculation process, the organizational clarity of the output is strong. The model organizes the content well into numbered sections, making it easy for the reader to follow the response.\n\nGiven these assessments, it seems that:\n\n- Factual correctness is completely accurate, covering all key points.\n- Logical reasoning is clear and rigorous.\n- The content presents the information in an organized manner, fully addressing the requirements of the task.\n\nThus, the overall score for the model's response should be a 5, as it meets all the highest standards of accuracy, logical reasoning, and output organization."
