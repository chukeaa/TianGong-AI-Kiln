  "output": "To calculate the free settling velocity of spherical particles in a fluid, consider the following approach:\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Forces Acting on the Particle**:\n   - **Net Force**: The difference between gravitational force (downward) and buoyant force (upward).\n     \\[\n     F_{\\text{net}} = (\\rho_p - \\rho_f) V_p g\n     \\]\n     where \\(V_p = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\) is the particle's volume.\n\n2. **Drag Force**:\n   - **Laminar Flow (Stokes' Law)**: When Reynolds number \\(Re < Re_{\\text{critical}}\\),\n     \\[\n     F_d = 6\\pi \\eta r v_t\n     \\]\n   - **Turbulent Flow**: When \\(Re \\geq Re_{\\text{critical}}\\), use quadratic drag:\n     \\[\n     F_d = \\frac{1}{2} C_d A \\rho_f v_t^2\n     \\]\n     where \\(A = \\pi r^2\\) is the cross-sectional area and \\(C_d\\) (drag coefficient) is typically around 0.45 for spheres.\n\n3. **Terminal Velocity**:\n   - **Laminar Flow**:\n     \\[\n     v_{t1} = \\frac{(\\rho_p - \\rho_f) g r^2}{\\eta}\n     \\]\n   - **Turbulent Flow**:\n     Substitute \\(F_{\\text{net}} = F_d\\) and solve for \\(v_{t2}\\):\n     \\[\n     v_{t2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (\\rho_p - \\rho_f) V_p g}{C_d A \\rho_f}}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine Flow Regime**:\n   Calculate Reynolds number \\(Re\\):\n   \\[\n   Re = \\frac{\\rho_f v d}{\\eta}\n   \\]\n   where \\(d = 2r\\) is the diameter. Use Stokes' law if \\(Re < Re_{\\text{critical}}\\), else use quadratic drag.\n\n### Example Calculation:\n- **Given**: Particle radius \\(r = 1 \\, mm\\), \\(\\rho_p = 2000 \\, kg/m^3\\), fluid density \\(\\rho_f = 997 \\, kg/m^3\\), viscosity \\(\\eta = 1e-3 \\, Pa·s\\).\n- **Laminar Velocity**:\n  \\[\n  v_{t1} = \\frac{(2000 - 997) \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot (0.001)^2}{1e-3} \\approx 0.0098 \\, m/s\n  \\]\n- **Reynolds Number**:\n  \\[\n  Re = \\frac{997 \\cdot 0.0098 \\cdot 0.002}{1e-3} \\approx 0.0195 < 0.2\n  \\]\n  Thus, use Stokes' law.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe terminal velocity for the particle is approximately \\(0.0098 \\, m/s\\), and since \\(Re\\) is below the critical value, Stokes' law applies in this scenario.",
