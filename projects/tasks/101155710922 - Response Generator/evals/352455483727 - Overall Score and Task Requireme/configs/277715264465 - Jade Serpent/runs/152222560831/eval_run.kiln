  "input": "某农业区土壤受镉（$Cd$）污染，污染浓度为$5 mg/kg$，超出国家标准（$1 mg/kg$）。该地区计划通过植物修复技术降低土壤中的镉浓度。假设一种高效植物每年能从土壤中提取$0.5 mg/kg$的镉，计算该植物修复该地区土壤至标准水平所需的时间。",
  "output": "要计算修复时间，首先确定土壤中需要去除的镉总量：5 - 1 = 4 mg/kg。植物每年提取0.5 mg/kg，所需时间为4 ÷ 0.5 = 8年。\n\n**答案：该地区需8年时间修复至标准水平。**",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "The model's output demonstrates strong performance across the evaluation criteria:\n\n1) **Factual Correctness**: The output accurately identifies the initial concentration of cadmium in the soil (5 mg/kg), acknowledges how much needs to be removed to meet the standard (4 mg/kg), and correctly states the annual extraction capability of the plant (0.5 mg/kg). The conclusion that it would take 8 years to reach the standard is factually correct.\n\n2) **Logical Reasoning**: The model outlines a clear logical progression: it first calculates the amount of cadmium that needs to be removed and then divides that by the annual extraction rate, arriving at a reasonable conclusion.\n\n3) **Calculation Process**: The calculation steps are well organized, clearly illustrating the process of determining the total removal needed and the time required based on the extraction rate. The model does not have any notable errors or omissions during the calculation.\n\nGiven these points, the model presents a completely accurate and well-reasoned response, fulfilling all key requirements of the task. Therefore, the appropriate overall score for this task is **5 points**."
