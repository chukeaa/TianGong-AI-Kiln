  "input": "如何利用同位素示踪技术进行环境污染源的追踪？",
  "output": "同位素示踪技术通过分析环境样品中稳定同位素（如碳、氮、氧的同位素）或放射性同位素的组成，确定污染物的来源和扩散路径。不同污染源具有特定的同位素指纹，能够帮助区分污染源并追踪其迁移过程。",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance based on the provided output, let's analyze it against the established requirements for accuracy.\n\n1. **Factual Correctness**: The output accurately explains how stable isotopes (such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) or radioactive isotopes can be used to identify pollution sources and trace their pathways. It mentions that different pollution sources possess unique isotopic fingerprints, which is a key point in the application of isotope tracing in environmental studies. Therefore, the factual correctness is high. There are no significant omissions or errors.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning**: The reasoning is clear and logically follows from the explanation of isotope tracing to its implications in tracing pollution sources. The information flows well and is coherent, demonstrating a good understanding of the subject.\n\n3. **Calculation Process**: The task does not involve numerical calculations, as it is primarily conceptual. However, the output is constructed in an organized manner and adequately addresses the question posed without disorganized thoughts or missing steps.\n\nGiven these evaluations, the output is factually correct, logically sound, and well-organized, fulfilling the requirements for a score of **5 points**. There are no major errors or omissions, and it aligns completely with the expected understanding of the topic.\n\nThus, the appropriate overall score for this task would be **5**."
