  "input": "假如当日北京市环境空气质量首要污染物为$PM_{2.5}$，当日$PM_{2.5}$的24小时平均浓度为$100$微克/立方米。请计算当日北京空气质量指数（$AQI$）。",
  "output": "当日北京市空气质量指数（AQI）计算如下：\n\n根据中国环境监测总站的标准，PM₂.₅的24小时平均浓度限值及其对应的AQI范围如下：\n- 51-100微克/立方米：AQI为51-100。\n\n已知PM₂.₅浓度为100微克/立方米，因此AQI指数为100。\n\n答案：$\\boxed{100}$",

    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance on this task, let's analyze it based on the provided requirements:\n\n1) **Factual Correctness**: The model correctly identifies that the primary pollutant is PM₂.₅ and correctly states that when the 24-hour average concentration is 100 micrograms per cubic meter, the AQI falls within the range of 51-100, which translates to an AQI of 100. There are no factual inaccuracies in this part.\n\n2) **Logical Reasoning**: The reasoning presented is clear and follows the necessary logical steps to arrive at the conclusion. The model cites the relevant concentration ranges and clearly explains how to derive the AQI from the given PM₂.₅ concentration. There are no significant flaws, and the conclusions drawn are aligned with the expected answer.\n\n3) **Calculation Process**: The model presents an organized process by first referencing the concentration ranges for PM₂.₅ and then applying this to conclude that an average concentration of 100 micrograms per cubic meter leads to an AQI of 100. The steps are outlined satisfactorily, and the method used adheres to the correct approach for calculating the AQI.\n\nOverall, the model's output is:\n- **Factual correctness**: Completely accurate.\n- **Logical reasoning**: Clear and rigorous, closely following the expected reasoning.\n- **Calculation process**: Correct results with well-organized steps.\n\nGiven this assessment, the model fully meets the highest standard for each of the criteria.\n\nTherefore, an appropriate overall score for this task would be **5**."
