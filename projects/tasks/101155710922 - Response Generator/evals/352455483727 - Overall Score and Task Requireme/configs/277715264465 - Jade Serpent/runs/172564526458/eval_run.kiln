  "input": "某农业区土壤受镉（$Cd$）污染，污染浓度为$5 mg/kg$，超出国家标准（$1 mg/kg$）。该地区计划通过植物修复技术降低土壤中的镉浓度。假设一种高效植物每年能从土壤中提取$0.5 mg/kg$的镉，计算该植物修复该地区土壤至标准水平所需的时间。",
  "output": "土壤中的镉浓度为 $5\\,\\text{mg/kg}$，国家标准为 $1\\,\\text{mg/kg}$。需要通过植物修复将土壤镉浓度降低到标准水平。\n\n**计算**：\n\n土壤镉浓度需要降低的幅度为：\n$$\\Delta C = 5 - 1 = 4\\,\\text{mg/kg}$$\n\n植物每年提取镉的效率为 $0.5\\,\\text{mg/kg/year}$。因此，土壤镉浓度降低到标准水平所需的时间为：\n$$T = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\text{提取效率}} = \\frac{4}{0.5} = 8\\,\\text{年}$$\n\n**答**：\n通过该高效植物修复土壤至国家标准水平所需时间为 8年。",
